# Genre Map #

The goal of this project is to map out the genres of music I listen to, across the time dimension to produce a visual map over time of where my musical brain itch has been, and what exactly has scratched it.


## Background : ##
---
I've always been fascinated with the evolution and cyclic nature of music tastes and what triggers the tectonic shift from genre to genre.
A prime example of this would be my first week in February I spent binging the artist 'High Priest of Saturn' - a Psychadelic Norwegian Doom Metal band, categorized by Spotify; I then spent most of the second and third weeks of the same month listening to 'Pusha T', 'Kendrick Lamar' and 'Logic' - each of which strongly rooted in the rap genre, with elements of gangster rap and 'concious' rap ... whatever the fuck that is.

## Concept : ##
---
A small application similar to Spotify Unwrapped but on a more indepth scale to identify trends in music genre shifts and also highlight artists by association which I would otherwise have missed or not found as quickly - all of this in a very visual format.

Ideally I would then open this to a small group of people to test if successful, though I am not entirely deluded as I know that is a long way off - especially with my tendancy to focus on whatever next week's grand idea will be.

## Implementation : ##
---
MVP : 

An angular application which connects to Spotify, grabs my playlists and focuses on a designated playlist - in this case my GenreMap playlist - then uses the datetime I have added the tracks to form a map of the genres of each tune; traversable over time via a slider or some better control if I find one

## Bonus Points : ##

Specific playlist selection via GUI

Profile switching capability

Utilization of Personalization API

## Super Bonus Points : ##

Fancy schmancy CSS
